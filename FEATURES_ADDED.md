## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Make sure Supabase is running
npx supabase start

# Run the migration
npx supabase db push
```

This will create all the tables, indexes, policies, and seed data.

### Step 2: Generate TypeScript Types

```bash
# Generate types from database schema
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

This will fix all TypeScript errors by generating proper types for the new tables.

### Step 3: Update Routes

Add these routes to your router configuration:

```typescript
import OrderHistory from '@/pages/OrderHistory';
import AdminDashboard from '@/pages/AdminDashboard';

// Add to routes
<Route path="/orders" element={<OrderHistory />} />
<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

### Step 4: Add Navigation Links

Update your navigation to include:
- Order History link
- Admin Dashboard link (for admin users)

```
